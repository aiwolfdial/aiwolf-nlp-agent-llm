For werewolf game rules including roles and flow, please refer to [logic.md](https://github.com/aiwolfdial/aiwolf-nlp-server/blob/main/doc/logic.md).

Competition participants need to implement agents and run them on their own terminals to connect to the game server provided by the competition organizers. There are no restrictions on agent implementation, including the programming language.
For self-play, you can run 5 or 13 agents on your own terminal and connect to the self-play game server provided by the competition organizers to battle between agents.

For game servers for local testing and self-play, please refer to [aiwolfdial/aiwolf-nlp-server](https://github.com/aiwolfdial/aiwolf-nlp-server).

## Environment Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Python 3.11 or higher is required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiwolfdial/aiwolf-nlp-agent.git
cd aiwolf-nlp-agent
cp config/config.yml.example config/config.yml
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

> [!NOTE]
> aiwolf-nlp-common is a Python package that defines programs related to roles and connection methods.
> For details, please refer to [aiwolfdial/aiwolf-nlp-common](https://github.com/aiwolfdial/aiwolf-nlp-common).

## How to Run

### Running the Agent

```bash
python src/main.py
```

#### How to Start with a Specific Configuration File

By default, it starts by referring to the settings in `config/config.yml`.
Methods for specifying and starting, or running multiple configuration files simultaneously are as follows:

```bash
python src/main.py -c config/config_1.yml # To specify config/config_1.yml
python src/main.py -c config/config_1.yml config/config_2.yml # To specify config/config_1.yml and config/config_2.yml
python src/main.py -c config/config_*.yml # To specify config/config_*.yml
```

### Running in Local Environment

You need to start the game server in advance.
Please refer to [aiwolfdial/aiwolf-nlp-server](https://github.com/aiwolfdial/aiwolf-nlp-server).

### How to Battle in Preliminaries

You can battle by connecting to the address published on Slack that you will be invited to after registration.
Please change the relevant items in [Configuration](#web_socket) and then run the agent.

### How to Battle in Finals

You can battle by connecting to the address published on Slack that you will be invited to after registration.
In the finals, please set `web_socket.auto_reconnect` to `true`.
Please change the relevant items in [Configuration](#web_socket) and then run the agent.
Due to battle situations, there may be times when the competition management server is stopped, so connection errors (`[Errno 61] Connection refused`) may occur and automatic reconnection may be repeated.

## Configuration (config/config.yml)

### web_socket

`url`: The URL of the game server. If connecting to a local game server, the default value is fine.
`token`: The token for connecting to the game server. Please set the token provided by the competition organizers.
`auto_reconnect`: Setting for whether to automatically reconnect after a battle ends.

### agent

`num`: The number of agents to start. For self-play, the default value is fine.
`team`: The team name of the agent. Please set the team name provided by the competition organizers.
`kill_on_timeout`: Setting for whether to interrupt request processing on action timeout.

### log

`console_output`: Setting for whether to output logs to the console.
`file_output`: Setting for whether to output logs to files.
`output_dir`: The path to the directory where logs are saved.
`level`: The log output level. Set one of `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.

#### log.requests

`name`, `initialize`, `daily_initialize`, `whisper`, `talk`, `daily_finish`, `divine`, `guard`, `vote`, `attack`, `finish`: Settings for whether to output logs for each request.
